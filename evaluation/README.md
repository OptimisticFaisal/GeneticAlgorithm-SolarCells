## Evaluation
> Example for **ZnO**

### 1. Obtain results `.xlsx` file
* Run: `ZnO_Main_frontend_gui.m`
* This will output the Accuracy, Mean number of simulations, and Standard Deviation of the mean in a `.xlsx` file.

### 2. Plot performance graph
* Run: `evaluation/roulette_graphing_code.m`
* In order to use the graphing script, 3 additional columns - Population count, Generation count, and Mutation rate need to be added in columns A, B, and C, respectively in the excel sheet.
* Accuracy, Mean number of simulation, and Standard Deviation should be on columns E, F, and G. The first data should from row 3.
* **Note**: This has already been done in the provided Excel files.
